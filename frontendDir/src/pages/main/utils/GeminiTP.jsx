The data I provide is based on general information and should be confirmed closer to your travel dates using dedicated travel websites and apps (e.g., Booking.com, Expedia, Google Maps, etc.).\n*   **Image URLs:** I will provide placeholder image URLs (e.g., `https://example.com/`). You\'ll need to replace these with actual image URLs from Google Images, hotel websites, or other sources.\n*   **Geolocation:**  I will do my best to provide accurate coordinates, but always double-check them using a mapping service before your trip.\n*   **Specific Preferences:** Let me know if you have any specific interests (e.g., "historical sites," "beaches," "nightlife") so I can tailor the recommendations accordingly.\n*   **Driving Route Options**: I will generate one driving route , you may need to compare other driving routes on google maps.\n\nI look forward to helping you create a fantastic trip! Provide the requested information so I can start planning.\n',
